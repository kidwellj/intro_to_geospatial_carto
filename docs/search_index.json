Let’s start by looking at some digital maps to see how this works in practice: Example 1, international environmental and development NGOs: https://ngoaidmap.org/ https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map https://resourcewatch.org/data/pulse https://www.vizzuality.com/projects/half-earth http://geocat.kew.org/ Example 2, local municipalities http://www.di.unito.it/~schifane/smellymaps/ http://www.urbandisplacement.org/migrationmap https://qhood01.github.io/nycSQF/ http://openseweratlas.tumblr.com/map http://www.arqueocordoba.com/rutas/index_en.html Lots of samples here: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/projects/ …and here: https://carto.com/gallery/ "],

Once you are logged in you can start to tinker with the platform. Let’s begin by building a data set, so you can get a sense of how those points get on the (digital) map. 2.1 Part 1, building a data set: In Carto, create an empty map. You do this by clicking on “New map” from the second toolbar while in your Carto dashboard. Then click on “Create Empty Map” on the right hand side. This will take a minutes. From the dialogue that comes up, click “Add points” The map will begin at the whole world. First zoom in (double click on the map, or click on the + sign on the left corner and click + drag the map to center it properly) until you can just see the UK. Zoom in a bit futher on to greater Birmingham. Notice how Carto gives you a number for your “zoom level” on the left hand side. You should eventually be on zoom level 10, centered on Birmingham. The backgrond map is called a “base map”. Carto gives you several options to choose from. Click on “Change basemap” in the bottom left corner, and test out different basemaps until you find one you like. Now click and drag until you find your residence in Birmingham, probably around zoom level 17. Add a point for your place of residence. Note, you may need to “discard” the point and add a new one, using the add button on the bottom right-hand corner (it’s a circle with a + on it). Simply click on the map to add your point. Then click “done”. Now switch to “data view” (it’s on the top, in the centre). Data view looks a lot like a spreadsheet, except there are coordinates and a bit of information about the point you’ve just put down. Double-click in the box for name and description and add some relevant information for your point on the table. Next, add a new column (click on the small down arrow next to “name” column) and click on “Add new column” give the column a new name “rating”. Change the data type to “number” - you can do this by bring up the column settings menu (down arrow at the top of the column next to the title) and clicking on “Change data type”. Select “number” and then click on “OK, Change it”. Next, I’d like you to add several other points to your map for the local area. To make this simple, think of an arbitrary category around which to add some points of interest, maybe coffee shops, restaurants, study places, etc. Add at least five features to the map (click on the small button on the bottom right hand side - a circle with a +) which fit in this category. Make sure you are placing them at accurate locations (at zoom level 17). Now add “metadata” - give each point a name, brief description, and then fill in a number to rate those sites based on your personal sense of the place. I recommend you use a five point scale with 5 being “best” and 1 being “worst”. Once you have a table in data view that has 6 rows, you’re ready to move on to the next step. 2.2 Part 2, visualising your data: Switch to “Map View” Zoom out until you can see all your points on the screen. The easiest way to do this is by clicking on the layer number (“1”) to open the drawer for the menu. Open up the “map layer wizard” toolbar on the right hand side (it may already be open as it’s the default). Rename your table from “untitled table” to something descriptive (maybe “my neighbourhood”). You should already be on the “wizards” pane (icon of square with paintbrush) but switch to this if you aren’t already there Change the map type from “simple” to “bubble” Change the max radius to 50 so we’ll have a more dramatic effect (radius is the third line under options, the max is the second box). Change the bubble fill to your favourite colour. Do this by clicking on the coloured rectangle, which will bring up a range of options. Now, switch to the info window pane (icon is a text bubble) - note that there are tabs for “click” and “hover” Set the “hover” setting to display the name of each of your sites and the “click” setting to show name and description. Move the mouse over your points on the map to see how this behaviour works. Return to the “map layer wizard menu” and make the dots 60% transparent (0.6). Do this by clicking on the down/up arrows next to the box with a number in it. This should be to the right of “Bubble fill” Now zoom out (zoom level 12 or lower). Try out a few different map types to see which is best for visualising your data at this zoom level. Try “choropleth,” “heat map” and “intensity”. Now you’re familiar with the basics of Carto! Let’s move onto the next challenge. "]
