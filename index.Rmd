# Introduction to the module {-}

This module has been designed to enable independent learners to gain a basic familiarity with data visualisation, using the CartoDB platform.

Ideally, a student should expect to invest at least four hours in independent learning activities over the course of a week. It should be possible to work through this a bit more slowly and in-depth. I have tried to point to a range of resources, both those which are accessible and those which are challenging.

For the week, we have divided content into four challenges. Included here (and below) is a brief introduction to the course. There are four additional sessions, which each have associated activities.
